<h3>(YEAR OF THE HEGIRA 1276.)</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Many,</span> and in sooth foolish, are they
who writing books send them
forth to the world with humiliating
disparagement of their contents and
servile appeals for mercy to those who may
read them. Now a man who hath dates, or
coffee, or rice to sell goeth not into the
market-place crying out, “Lo! the merchandise
which I offer for sale is poor and mouldy
and unworthy stuff; yet of your charity,
good people, I pray you to buy,” seeking
yet to cajole his hearers with coarse flattery.
As if any man were silly enough to buy
damaged goods because, forsooth, the vendor
praised the good judgment of the buyer!</p>

<p>I, who have made the pilgrimage and
kissed the Kaaba which endowed with truth,
am not as the Franks who trust to the beguilement
of the Stone of Bel-Ârni. This
volume, containing the surprising adventures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
of the good Kayenna and the marvellous
wisdom of Shacabac, the Wayfarer, needeth
no apology. If it excelleth all other works
of history in lofty thought, in rich imagery,
in polished style, and in perfect diction, it is
only because I have made it to do so. Had
it existed in the days of the good Caliph
Omar, wisest of all censors, it would not
have shared the fate of that mass of unworthy
literature by him justly condemned
to the flames. Rather would it have been
commended to all the faithful as a work
not to be hastily skimmed by the light and
thoughtless who seek transitory knowledge
in the public libraries, but to be <em>bought</em> and
preserved for careful and frequent study by
the discriminating reader.</p>

<p>While the work of no mortal is perfect,
the only defect in this book is its brevity.
Its merits are as many as its words. If
any man fail to recognize them, let him
wisely be silent, and, returning the book
to him from whom he borrowed it, pray
Allah for better judgment and mourn the
hour in which he, unworthy, ever learned
to read.</p>

<h3>He that repenteth too late may some
time worry too soon.—<em>The Kâtâmarana.</em></h3>
</div>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> Pasha Muley Mustapha was
unhappy. He was a peaceloving,
easy-tempered man, as
Pashas go, and, when allowed to have
his own way, was never inclined to ask
for more. But now, after seven years
of wedded life, he found his wishes
thwarted, not for the first time, by the
caprice of a woman, and that woman
his only wife, Kayenna, well surnamed
the Eloquent. The misunderstanding
had arisen, innocently enough, in this
way:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“I think, my dear,” said Muley
Mustapha, as he sat smoking his nargileh
one day at the beginning of this
history, while his wife reclined on a
divan,—“I think, my dear, that my
parents (may their memory be blessed!)
made a great mistake in their treatment
of me in my youth. I was brought up
too strictly. They gave me no opportunity
of seeing life in all its phases.
Consequently, I find myself, in middle
age, almost a stranger among my own
subjects. I mean to adopt an entirely
different system with little Muley.”</p>

<p>“In what way?” asked his wife, rising
on her elbow, and casting a suspicious
look at her lord.</p>

<p>“Well, in this way,” replied Muley
Mustapha, deliberately,—“in this way.
I intend to let him go out into the
world, mingle with the youth of his
own age, share in their sports, and, as
the Giaours say, ‘sow his wild oats.’”</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="p014" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p014.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">
<p class="no-indent">“<em>‘In what way?’ asked his wife</em>”</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>“Muley Mustapha,” said his wife,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>sitting bolt upright, “you shall do
nothing of the sort. ‘Sow his wild
oats,’ indeed! He shall never leave
my sight, not for a single moment,
until he is a grown man and I have
provided him with a wife to take my
place as guardian of his morals. It ill
becomes the trusted vassal of my noble
father, the Sultan of Kopaul, to talk
thus of corrupting the child who is to
be one day ruler of that mighty empire.
You forget that fact, Muley
Mustapha.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” retorted the
Pasha, a little tartly, “I am not likely
to forget it, so long as the daughter of
the Sultan of Kopaul condescends to
remain the wife of the Pasha of
Ubikwi.”</p>

<p>For Muley Mustapha had married
above his station, and the circumstance
had not been permitted to escape his
memory. He never complained of his
lot; but, when his faithful Vizier once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
hinted that the Koran allowed each
true believer the blessing of four wives,
he answered with a sigh, “I find one
enough for this world: the rest I will
take in houris.”</p>

<p>Some subtle reflection of that sentiment
must have made itself visible on
the face of the Pasha at this moment;
for his worthy spouse, with apparent
irrelevance, suddenly exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“Muley Mustapha, if you are going
to cast your vagabond Vizier in my
face, I will leave the room—until I
have time to go home to my father,
who will protect me from insult.”</p>

<p>“Great Allah!” cried the Pasha.
“Who is casting anybody in your face?
And who has mentioned the name of
the Vizier?”</p>

<p>But the virtuous Kayenna had risen
to her feet, and in low, intense tones
began:—</p>

<p>“Sir, there is a limit to what even a
wife may endure. When I think that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
a son of mine is threatened with contamination
at the hands of a low, disreputable,
adventurous vagabond, like
your worthless underling”—</p>

<p>Here the good lady was so overcome
by her feelings that she burst into a
flood of tears, and had to be borne,
shrieking, to her apartments.</p>

<p>“I foresee that I shall have trouble
in bringing up that boy,” mused Muley
Mustapha, as he relighted his nargileh,
and stroked his flowing beard.</p>

<p>Braver man there was not in all Islam
than the dauntless young Pasha of
Ubikwi, whose valor on many a hard-fought
field finally won him the favor of
the Sultan of Kopaul, and the fair hand
of that Sultan’s only child. Once, some
years after his marriage, he propounded
to Shacabac the Wayfarer, then a sage
whose merits had not been appreciated
by a dull generation, the old
paradox of the Frankish schoolmen:
“When an irresistible force meets with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
an immovable object,
what happeneth?”
And the wise man answered,
“In case of
matrimony, the Force
retireth from business.”
Struck by the
aptness of the reply,
Muley Mustapha
made the sage his
Vizier on the spot.</p>

<p>From that day forth
the Pasha had peace
in his household.
There is much virtue
in self-abnegation;
but, like most
unconditional surrenders,
it does not always
evoke the admiration
of the victors.
Yet was Muley Mustapha
not without his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
reward. Kayenna knew just how far
she might venture in dictating to him,
and, by judiciously yielding that for
which she cared naught, managed ever
to obtain that which she desired.
Thus doth the wise spouse gain new
raiment by denying to her lord the
society of an unbeloved mother-in-law.</p>

<h3>A lie grows so fast that its own parents may not
recognize it.—<em>Deucalion.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Three</span> days after the occurrence
of the events narrated in the
preceding chapter a venerable
man, clad in the robes of a physician,
was ushered into the presence
of the Pasha. He salaamed low, and
said,—</p>

<p>“Great and mighty Pasha, I bring
thee good news.”</p>

<p>“Speak,” said the Pasha: “what is
thy news?”</p>

<p>“Great and good tidings,” answered
the leech. “Mother and child are
doing well.”</p>

<p>“Allah be blessed!” said Muley
Mustapha. “And the boy? My own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
little Muley! Is he a healthy, comely
lad,—such an one, think you, as will
hold his own among the gallants of
the land, and not prove a puny milksop,
clutching his mother’s apronstring?”</p>

<p>“Truly, O potent Pasha,” was the
answer, “it is a fair and well-formed
child, but”—</p>

<p>“But me no buts, knave,” roared
the Pasha. “Darest thou say the
boy is deformed,—blind,—deaf,—lame?
Speak, or by the beard of the
Prophet”—</p>

<p>“Mercy, O gracious lord! I meant
nothing,” cried the sage, falling on his
knees, “only this—the child”—</p>

<p>“Well, go on, and quickly. The
child”—</p>

<p>“Is a girl, O great and mighty”—</p>

<p>But Muley Mustapha had leaped to
his feet, spurning the old man from his
way, and was shouting to his chief
eunuch:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>“Ho, there, slave! Send me straightway
the Vizier and the Soothsayer and—hark
ye, slave, send me the Headsman.
By Allah! there is work here
for all three.”</p>

<p>The Pasha had a rich command of
language, and he made free use of
it while awaiting the summoned functionaries.
Soon they were ushered into
his presence, the swart Nubian, Al
Choppah, bringing up the rear of the
procession. The Soothsayer prostrated
himself at the feet of the Pasha, who
thus addressed him:—</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>“O triple-tongued liar and silverhaired
son of Gehenna, what hast thou
to say for thyself? Dost remember
that but six months ago thou didst
issue a prophecy, standing before us as
proud and confident as Bhilibidam, the
haughty prince of Eblis, and didst say
that I was to be the father of a son,
and didst warrant the prediction with
thy head? What should be done, O
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>Shacabac, with such a defaulter on his
sacred pledge?”</p>

<p>“So please your Highness,” replied
the Vizier, promptly, “I should foreclose
on the security.”</p>

<p>“It is well said,” quoth the Pasha,
and, signing to the Nubian, bade him
advance and do his duty.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="p023" style="max-width: 54.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p023.jpg" alt="Man kneeling in front of another">
</figure>
<br>

<p>Al Choppah ran his thumb along the
edge of his scimitar, swung it slowly
aloft, and was about to bring it down,
when the Soothsayer, in a trembling
voice, cried out: “The will of Allah be
done! But hath not thine own trusted
adviser counselled mercy to all creatures,
even to the least merciful? And,
even though I die, I tell thee that the
child born to thee this day shall reign
over Kopaul!”</p>

<p>Astounded and secretly a little impressed
by this remarkable speech,
Muley Mustapha signed to the Nubian
to withdraw to the ante-chamber.
Then, bidding the Soothsayer stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
up, he said sternly: “Do not dare
hope to escape thy doom by laughing
at our beard. Explain thy riddle; but,
first, Shacabac, what means the slave by
saying that thou hast counselled mercy
even to the least merciful of creatures?”</p>

<p>Shacabac, who did not disdain the
music of his own voice, replied:—</p>

<p>“Truly, this Soothsayer hath deeply
offended; but he showeth a proper
taste in literature, and, perchance, seeth
more of the future than ordinary
mortals. It is true, I have counselled
mercy to all creatures; for mercy
may sometimes be wisdom. I have
said:—</p>

<p>“‘Kick not the sleeping tiger in thy
path; and, if thou meetest a shark in
the river, go thy way,—the sea is wide
enough for him and for thee.</p>

<p>“‘Utter no evil, not even of the
dumb beasts. If thy horse offend thee,
put him away from thee; and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
thou sellest him, speak only of his
good parts.’</p>

<p>“I have also written: ‘Dispute not
with thy neighbor if his hens permeate
thy garden, but bid them welcome and
give them shelter. So shalt thou have
fresh-laid eggs for thy breakfast.’</p>

<p>“As to this wretched Soothsayer, I
fear me much his character as a prophet
is sorely damaged. Nevertheless, as I
have written elsewhere:—</p>

<p>“‘A bad character is better than none
at all. Rather behave ill than have
men say of thee, “Lo, he knoweth not
how to behave.”’”</p>

<p>Just then appeared a slave with the
startling tidings that a messenger from
the great Sultan of Kopaul had arrived
and besought an interview.</p>

<p>If Shacabac was annoyed at being
interrupted in the pleasant pastime of
quoting from his own works, which is
said to be not a displeasing diversion
with other great writers, the Pasha<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
quickly recalled him to more pressing
matters, by saying: “Now, Shacabac,
great is thy written wisdom. Mayhap
thou hast wit enough to tell us how we
may break the news to the great Sultan,
my father-in-law, that his ‘grandson’—dog
of a Star-gazer, that was <em>thy</em> precious
work!—is a granddaughter.”</p>

<p>But even the wisdom of Shacabac
was unequal to such a contingency;
and this true story would never have
been written, had not the Soothsayer
averted an irreparable loss to literature
by humbly asking permission to speak.</p>

<p>“Speak,” replied the Pasha, “and
see that thy words be precious; for on
them hangs thy life.”</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, the Soothsayer
first asked, how many people knew of
the child’s sex. He was informed
that, besides themselves there present,
only the mother and the attendant
physician as yet possessed that knowledge;
but the whole country would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
know of it, to their grief, when the
wrathful Sultan learned how his hopes
had been blighted. “And upon my
head, O wretched juggler,” cried the
Pasha, “shall fall the chief weight of
his anger. Accursed be the hour in
which I was not born a girl!” The
last two words he uttered with infinite
grief and scorn.</p>

<p>“Then, O Pasha, the country is safe,
if the Physician be silenced, and we,
keeping the secret to ourselves, inform
the Sultan that his daughter and <em>grandson</em>
are doing well. The Sultan is very
old (may his years be many!), and he
will have gone to his fathers long ere
he discover the deception; and thou
and thy noble spouse shall reign in
Kopaul ere anybody know, if they ever
know, that thy son is <em>not</em> thy son.”</p>

<p>Audacious as was this proposition,
yet the Pasha grasped at it as a drowning
man at a straw, especially as it met
the approval of Shacabac. He generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
accepted the advice of that wise
and good philosopher.</p>

<p>The Soothsayer and the Physician
were enjoined to strict silence; and, the
better to insure it, they were commended
to the care of Al Choppah, the
Nubian, who, being a mute, could tell
no tales. His two guests do not appear
again in this history.</p>

<h3>The hardest thing to find is an honest partner for
a swindle.—<em>Samith.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">But</span> it was absolutely necessary
for the peace and dignity of the
realm of Ubikwi that the court
should not be without an official Soothsayer.
Wherefore the vacant office was
presently filled by a young and promising
astrologer, Badeg by name, who
had studied for some years at the feet
of his lamented predecessor.</p>

<p>Muley Mustapha, while secretly
contemning the whole science because
of the wretched blunder whereby he
thought himself the chief sufferer
(though the lately deceased soothsayer,
had he been able to give an opinion,
might have thought otherwise), found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
it hard work to keep up a pretence of
respecting the new incumbent and his
office. Kayenna, more alive to the
danger of arousing suspicion, took
pains on every occasion to show profound
respect for the holy man, and
never failed to enjoin a similar course
on the part of her lord. It was not
her fault if Muley Mustapha erred on
that or, indeed, on any line of policy;
for in all Ubikwi there was not a wife
more ready at all times to direct her
husband in the path of right.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there was something
about the new astrologer which caused
her uneasiness, worried Muley Mustapha,
and disturbed the serene imperturbability
of Shacabac. It was this.
Whenever he issued a prediction, were
it only a casual prophecy of the coming
weather, he always accompanied
it with a qualifying phrase, such as,
“Allah permitting,” “subject to other
conditions,” “errors and omissions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
excepted,” or something equally foreign
to all the traditions and precedents of
prophecy. At such times he was wont
to cast at Muley Mustapha, Kayenna,
or the good Shacabac a swift, furtive
glance which did not add to the mental
composure of any of them.</p>

<p>Yet, such is the effect of a guilty
conscience, not one of the three ever
questioned his slightest assurance, no
matter how the prediction turned out.
If he foretold “rains, followed by
showers, for the Lower Lake region,”
on a given day, and that day happened
to be the sunniest of the whole year,
the Pasha was sure to appear in waterproof
garments, with an umbrella ostentatiously
in his hand, and took pains, if
he met the prophet, to declare that this
was truly a wonderful season for rain,
but no doubt it would be good for the
crops. The Soothsayer never made
any reply other than, “Great is Allah,
and wonderful are his ways!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>Kayenna was annoyed and Shacabac
alarmed at the unwisdom on the part
of Muley Mustapha in thus overdoing
his part, especially as Badeg, grown
bolder with the immunity shown him,
began to be absolutely reckless in his
prognostications, sending out forecasts
of the stock market which, had they
been followed, would have bankrupted
the royal exchequer.</p>

<p>A deputation of traders called upon
the Pasha to protest; but the wise
Vizier met them with the calm assurance
that the prophet was a man
marked by heaven as insane, and therefore
doubly deserving of homage.
“Should his visitation prove chronic,”
said the sage, “it may be taken as a
sign that he should be made custodian
of the national treasury.” Whereupon
the merchants withdrew their protests,
averring with one voice that without
doubt the Soothsayer was sane and wise
beyond the sons of men, and that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
would thenceforth accept his predictions
as inspired, and govern themselves
accordingly. The which they
did; but it was noticed that the market
from that time became conservative,
and business flourished the more as it
was fostered the less by government,
even as the Giaour jest hath it, that the
patient getteth well or dieth without
the assistance of the doctors.</p>

<h3>A grandfather is a man who has two chances to
make a fool of himself, and seldom neglects them.—<em>Ginglymus.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">While</span> the events recorded in
the preceding chapter and
covering some years had
their influence on the affairs of state,
life within the harem went quietly
on. Kayenna, the faithful spouse of
Muley Mustapha, accepted the congratulations
of her friends on the birth
of little Muley; and it was remarked
that, so devoted a mother was she, nobody
but herself was ever allowed to
nurse or watch or otherwise care for the
beloved child.</p>

<p>“My daughter will spoil the brat
and bring him up a regular milksop,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
growled the great Sultan one day after
paying a prolonged visit to the happy
couple. “I thought you had an idea,
Muley, of rearing the boy to be a manly
fellow and letting him see the world.”</p>

<p>“Truly, I had,” was the reply, rather
sadly made; “but, as he is our only
child, his mother is so passionately attached
to him that I cannot find it in
my heart to train him as robustly as
I should wish.”</p>

<p>“Bosh!” ejaculated the fiery old
monarch. “My grandson should be
taught to fear nothing, whereas he
looks and acts like a girl. Send him
to Kopaul for a while, and I promise
you he will learn some manliness.”</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/p036-1.jpg" alt="Woman floating">
</figure>

<p>But to this proposition Kayenna
demurred so vigorously that the old
Sultan was forced to desist; for that
truly admirable woman had the happy
faculty, whether as daughter, wife,
or mother, of bending every will in
her own direction, which was that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
righteousness always. Heaven had
blessed her from infancy with a fine flow
of language, accompanied by a
noble firmness of purpose, so
that such was the repute of her
wisdom, whenever she opened
the coral portals of her speech,
the whole court was ready to
accept her dictum
on any question
rather than waste
time and invite humiliation
by the
fruitless attempt to
controvert her.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp45" id="p036-2" style="max-width: 37.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p036-2.jpg" alt="Two men talking">
</figure>

<p>The Sultan went home
discontented. Before departing,
he took Muley
Mustapha aside, and said
impressively: “Muley, if
I had a wife like yours, I
would teach her humility if
I used up a cord of bamboos
and half a dozen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
eunuchs.” Then, sighing heavily, he
added: “After all, it is not your fault,
but that of myself, who brought her up
sparingly as to the bamboo. If you
should ever have a <em>daughter</em>, Muley,”—the
Pasha gave a slight start at the
word,—“which Allah forbid!” continued
the Sultan, “take the advice of
an old man, and”—He finished the
sentence with an eloquent gesture of
the right arm extended from the shoulder
at an upward angle of forty-five
degrees, fingers close together, and
palm forward. This gesture, when
made with the arm raised perpendicularly,
is a sign of peace among the
Bedouins and other nomads. It was
not as such that the Sultan employed it.</p>

<p>“What did my father mean by lifting
his hand like the sail of a windmill?
And of what was he speaking as
he bade you farewell?” asked Kayenna,
when she and Muley found themselves
alone. “Oh, nothing,” was the reply.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
“He was talking about the education
of our daught”—</p>

<p>“Muley Mustapha! Do you mean
to say that <em>you told him</em>?”</p>

<p>“No, no, my dear, of course not.
Only when he said something about
our ever having a daughter, I was so
surprised that I feared he might have
suspected something, and for the moment
regretted that we had deceived
him about his ‘grandson.’”</p>

<p>“And, pray, who deceived him?”
queried Kayenna, with icy severity.
“I, for one, have not. I have never
told him that our little darling was or
was not a boy. If he choose to deceive
himself or to be deceived by tricksters
like your vagabond Vizier, that is his
own concern, not mine. I know what
his gesture signified; but, thank Allah,
corporal punishment was abolished in
<em>my</em> nursery by my angel mother, and
my honored sire has not forgotten the
occasion, I ween.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>Kayenna wore such a pensive smile
of retrospective happiness in saying this
that Muley Mustapha did not give a
moment’s entertainment to his father-in-law’s
counsel, but prudently resolved
to put the bamboo plant to other and
more profitable uses; and Shacabac, to
whom he confided his troubles, commented
sagely: “The spinster knoweth
how to bring up children, and the bachelor
to rule a wife. It is well that they
remain single: else who would be willing
to leave this happy world, had they
the direction of its family affairs?”</p>

<p>“How hath it happened,” asked the
Pasha, after ruminating some minutes
on this proposition, “that thou thyself
hast never married?”</p>

<p>“Solely in order that I might the
better devote myself to the improvement
and instruction of my fellowmen;
for, if there be one man on earth
who knoweth less than all others, it is
he who is the husband of a wife, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
she will be first to tell him the same.
While Allah preserveth her, his halo
shall never be too small for his head.</p>

<p>“No man knoweth what true happiness
is until he getteth married: then is
the knowledge rather a sweet memory
than a new boon.</p>

<p>“Twice blessed is he in whose tent
dwell both his mother and his wife’s
mother; for, even though he gain not
Paradise, yet shall he fear not Gehenna.</p>

<p>“In choosing a wife, disdain not
youth nor beauty; for these are things
which time will cure.</p>

<p>“Love not a woman for her riches;
but, loving first the riches, thou shalt
learn in time to love her for their
sake.</p>

<p><em>Shacabac, the Sage</em></p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>“There are two ways of missing the
miseries of matrimony: one is by not
getting married, the other by not being
born. The Prophet hath said that
there is a third, which is by always
overlooking the errors of thy partner.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>I know naught about this, but it recalleth
an apologue:—</p>

<p>“There were two brothers of Bassorah
who dwelt under the same roof,
both being married. They had the
misfortune, about the same time, to
offend their wives most grievously.
Kadijah, the wife of the elder, was so
incensed that she never again spoke to
her lord. Zobeide, the younger, not
only forgave her spouse, but made it a
point every day, in reminding him of
his fault, to forgive him again most
solemnly. Yet was the husband of
Zobeide no happier than that of
Kadijah; and when, finally losing patience,
she procured a divorce from
him, the ungrateful wretch only said,
‘It is better to have loved and lost
than never to have lost at all.’ Truly,
matrimony is a state into which none
but the wise should enter, and they do
not.”</p>

<p>Encouraged by the silent approval of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
the Pasha and fortified by a copious
draught of the strong waters forbidden,
but not unknown, to true believers,—concerning
the use whereof he had eloquently
written: “Hospitality saith,
‘Be blind when the guest helpeth himself
to thy wine flask; but be deaf when
he asketh for more’; also, ‘Tempt not
thy neighbor with the cup which inebriates,
lest he fall; but, if thy neighbor
offer thee to drink, refuse him not, lest
thou give him needless pain,’”—the
Sage continued:—</p>

<p>“To be constant in love to one
is good: to be constant to many is
great.</p>

<p>“Politeness between husband and
wife costeth nothing. Were it otherwise,
the virtue would be even rarer
than it now is.</p>

<p>“Marry not any woman out of gratitude,
lest perchance she come in time
to wonder where the reward cometh
in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>Furthermore, he inculcated the sage
maxim: “Save up money for a rainy
day, and it is sure to rain.”</p>

<p>He also added, perhaps irrelevantly,—for
like other great philosophers he
never allowed his mind to be fettered
by text or theme,—“Be not concerned
if thou findest thyself in possession of
unexpected wealth. Allah will provide
an unexpected use for it.”</p>

<p>In conclusion, he said impressively,
after vainly shaking the now empty wine-flask:
“It hath been said of the son of
the desert, ‘Lo! he hath sand’; but
what availeth a whole Sahara, and no
sugar to blend therewith? Or who
that hath a river before his door, and
never a cow in his barn, shall grow rich
in the milk business?”</p>

<p>To this pertinent question the venerable
Muley Mustapha made no rejoinder,
because in truth he had fallen
asleep ere the Sage had been fairly
launched on his discourse, which would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
have been lost to posterity, had not the
speaker thoughtfully taken notes of the
same,—a practice commended to all
preachers afflicted with drowsy congregations.</p>

<p>Shacabac withdrew silently from the
presence, musing—not for the first time—on
the generous lack of appreciation
bestowed by the great upon the wise.
As he was about to enter his humble
domicile, he suddenly perceived a large
tiger stretched sleeping before his hearth,
whereupon he moved noiselessly to the
roof of the house without disturbing
the fierce animal or alarming the other
inmates who might molest the unbidden
visitor. Unhappily, his delicacy was
but ill rewarded; for his rich and parsimonious
uncle, whose fortune he subsequently
inherited, on entering the
kitchen the next morning, was incontinently
devoured by the ungrateful
brute. The sad event was commemorated
by the Sage in a noble threnody,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
wherein the virtue of resignation is
beautifully set forth. Rare indeed was
the occasion, or dire the catastrophe,
from which the worthy man could not
extract some moral or material benefit.</p>

<p>Now here was a most serious complication.
The King of Nhulpar was
the mightiest monarch of all the earth.
Twenty caliphates trembled at his nod;
an hundred thousand lances were levelled
at his word; the number of wild riders
ready to follow his standard were as the
sands of the desert multiplied by the
sands of the seashore. When he said,
“Do this,” it must be done, whether it
could be done or not. In fact, he
rather liked performing impossibilities
by proxy, the daring one who failed in
the task being added to his Majesty’s
large and varied collection in the royal
mausoleum of Dedhed.</p>

<p>Had he known that the Sultan of
Kopaul in offering his “grandson’s”
hand in marriage to the Princess Amine
was essaying the most impossible of all
impossibilities, he would have been delighted
beyond expression. He had
not a single Sultan’s head in his album;
but even that of a Pasha was not to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
despised, as Muley Mustapha thought
with a shudder, when he was apprised
of his father-in-law’s well-meant but
most compromising negotiations.</p>

<p>What was to be done? It was not
possible much longer to deceive the
old Sultan; and it was absolutely out
of the question to traverse the wishes
of the fiery king.</p>

<p>“You see to what a pass you and
your vagabond Vizier have brought
us,” said Kayenna. “Now, mayhap,
you may be able between you to extricate
us from it.”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” stuttered the
bewildered Pasha, who did not see why
he was especially to blame for the blunder
of a dead and gone Soothsayer.
Then, clutching at the suggestion of a
companion in misery, he added: “By
all means, my dear, let us call in Shacabac;
and he may advise us for the best.
He has some very sound views upon
matrimony, I know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, no doubt he has,” said Kayenna,
ironically. “I can fancy what
they are like, but I should wish to
have him repeat them to me.” Kayenna
did not admire the abstruse philosophy
of Shacabac, which she did not
fully understand; but, with keen feminine
intuition, she knew that it could
be only evil, for she disliked the philosopher.
She was, however, seriously
impressed with one of his more homely
maxims, which she always endeavored
to follow, namely:—</p>

<p>“Talk not with thy guest of his
own affairs, for with those he is
sufficiently acquainted; but discourse
ever of thine own,—of thy good
luck and ill, of thy horses, thy servants,
thy children, and thine ailments.
If thou dost not succeed thereby in
making him feel at home, thou mayst
at least induce him to wish himself
there.”</p>

<p>Fortified by these maxims, Kayenna<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
consented to the presence of the Sage
at the family council.</p>

<p>The messenger despatched for Shacabac
found him in his lecture hall, discoursing
to a class of scholars on
Omens, and illustrating his words of
wisdom with apposite examples. Even
royalty had to wait until the precious
pearls falling from his lips should be
gathered by his hearers. He was
saying:—</p>

<p>“It is very lucky to find a horseshoe,
if there be a horse attached; but
unlucky, if the owner be about.</p>

<p>“It is a bad omen to meet, on leaving
thy house in the morning, a mad
dog, a tiger which hath not breakfasted,
or a man to whom thou owest
money.</p>

<p>“Steel cuts love. The great Sultan
Ras-el-Dasl never knew perfect conjugal
bliss after inadvertently throwing
the carving knife at his favorite
sultana.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“To break a mirror is also portentous
of evil. Backsheesh, the porter,
once incautiously smashed a large pierglass
over the head of his spouse; and
it cost him a month’s fees to replace
them both.</p>

<p>“It is unlucky to sleep thirteen in a
bed.”</p>

<p>Here the Sage was rudely interrupted
by a voice, which said, “I
know of something yet more unlucky
than all of these,—something which
neither great nor small, neither Pasha
nor Sage, may do with impunity.”</p>

<p>Shacabac fixed an angry eye in the
direction of the intruder, but lowered it
when he discovered the speaker to be
Badeg, who was gazing at him with a
contemptuous leer.</p>

<p>“I see a messenger from the palace,”
said the Sage; “and this class is now
dismissed. Badeg, I will speak with
thee anon; for I would fain know what
thou hast learned from the stars that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
more wondrous than the marvels of
which I have humbly discoursed.”</p>

<p>“Speak as thou wishest, or hold thy
tongue, if that be wiser,” replied the
Astrologer, insolently; “but my words
are for thy betters, who may find them
more precious than golden sequins, and
only less valuable than my silence.”</p>

<p>With this significant threat, Badeg
wrapped his mantle about him, and
strode away, leaving a visible impression
on the minds of the students, who
listened to him in wonder.</p>

<p>Shacabac, much disconcerted, repaired
to the palace, where he remained
long in consultation with the Pasha and
his spouse.</p>

<p>But, in a case wholly without precedent
in history or fiction, the wisdom
of even so great a man as Shacabac is
necessarily at fault: the experience of
one so aged as Muley Mustapha avails
no more than the instincts of a child.
Only the intuition of the superior mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
finds a solution of the difficulty, or,
at worst, a means of deferring the catastrophe.</p>

<p>The present case proved to be no exception.
After listening patiently to the
timid suggestions of her lord and the
ineffectual though sagacious aphorisms
of the Vizier, Kayenna calmly observed:
“I see that there is but one
way of settling the matter. I will go
with the child to Nhulpar.”</p>

<p>“And tell the King the truth?”
cried both men, in consternation.</p>

<p>“And tell the King the truth,”
echoed Kayenna, blandly.</p>

<p>“But it will cost both of your lives!”
exclaimed Shacabac.</p>

<p>“It will cost me my Pachalik,” cried
Muley Mustapha, dismally.</p>

<p>“It will cost fifty thousand gold sequins,
to begin with,” replied the noble
matron. “As a preliminary step, you
will order the First Lord of the Treasury
to go into the Street of the Moneychangers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
taking the Court Torturer
along with him, and solicit a loan of
that sum, at par, within half an hour.
I shall prepare for our departure on
the day after to-morrow, at sunrise.
You, Shacabac, will come with us. See
that the caravan and guards be ready
ere the break of day.”</p>

<h3>The man who can invent a good working substitute
for honesty has yet to be invented himself.—<em>Eastern
Proverb.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Great</span> were the rejoicings in
Ubikwi when the news was announced
that the young Prince
Muley was about to wed the daughter
of the mighty King of Nhulpar, becoming
thereby prospective heir not only
to the Pachalik of Ubikwi, but also to
a great Sultanship and a vastly greater
Kingdom. The people rejoiced with
great joy, not reflecting that, perchance,
the cost of sustaining the triple dignities
might fall heavy on their own
shoulders. But it hath ever been the
way of the populace to take delight in
increased burdens, provided the packages
only be gaudily decorated;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
wherein they differ from the camel
and the ass and other brute beasts,
which have no appreciation of æsthetics.</p>

<p>The merchants, especially, who everywhere
boast of being a conservative
class, that would rather pay ten piastres
of tribute than one for the suppression
of brigandage, hastened to lay their
loyal congratulations before the Pasha.
Shacabac received them affably, and
in reply to their address delivered a
discourse fraught with practical wisdom,
of which unhappily only a few fragments
have been preserved to this day;
but these are not without their value to
traders of another and a foreign generation.
He said:—</p>

<p>“We have all more or less to do
with Commerce. We buy goods, and
sometimes pay for them. We sell
the precious products of our hands or
brains at the best price we can get. If
the buyer pays up, we are sorry that we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
did not charge him more. If he fails,
we are glad that he did not decide to
pay less on the piastre. When we have
grown very rich, we speculate; and that
keeps us from being purse-proud and
haughty.</p>

<p>“Be diligent in keeping your accounts.
It is better to charge an item
twice than to forget to charge it once.
That is the true principle of Double
Entry.</p>

<p>“Pay as you go, but not if you intend
going for good.</p>

<p>“Boast not of your wealth; but let
humility curb your tongues when the
Assessor cometh around.</p>

<p>“Buy when the market is rising:
sell when it is going to fall. If you be
not a prophet, any friend on the Street
will notify you of each impending
change. Were it not for this unfailing,
beautiful trust in human nature,
few of us would be able to make
money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“In selling goods by sample, let the
samples be at least as good as the
bulk of the merchandise.</p>

<p>“Do not put all the best figs at the
top of the crate. Have just as good a
layer on the bottom also; for there are
sometimes evil-minded persons who
open the package at that end.</p>

<p>“Concerning truth: Do not believe
all that you hear or see,—not even in
the newspapers. Advertisers are human
and liable to err.</p>

<p>“It is a great mistake to suppose
that all men are rogues. If there were
not a large majority of fools in the
world, who would buy stocks?</p>

<p>“The essence of Free Trade is embodied
in the axiom: Buy in the cheapest
and sell in the dearest market.
This is absolutely correct. I myself
have bought shares for ‘half nothing,’
and doubled my money inside of a
week.</p>

<p>“Time is money. Every second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
saved at your mid-day lunch means
so many sequins by and by for your
family physician.</p>

<p>“Be not angry with your creditors, if
they importune you. It is nobler to
forgive and forget them.</p>

<p>“‘Three removes are as bad as a
fire,’ but that depends largely on how
you stand with the underwriters.</p>

<p>“Do not judge a customer by the
clothes he wears: he may not have
paid for them. Be courteous to all
men. The humblest of your neighbors
may sit upon your jury one day.</p>

<p>“A business man who finds it necessary
to attend a daily noon prayer-meeting
is either abnormally virtuous
or his piety is of a kind that needs a
good deal of stimulus to keep it going.”</p>

<p>A young man who had listened with
attention to this discourse came at the
close to Shacabac and asked, “How
shall I become rich without too much
trouble?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>“List to me,” replied the wise man,
“and I will teach thee in six easy consecutive
lessons, at one sequin per
lesson.”</p>

<p>The young man, joyfully complying,
paid the money, and sat at the feet of
the Sage. But, when the course was
over, he cried out, “Bismillah! thou
hast taught me naught.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” returned the Sage. “I have
taught thee how to make six sequins.
Go to, ungrateful one.”</p>

<p>And the ungrateful one, abashed at
the reproof, immediately opened a
Commercial College where every branch
of Business could be learned “while
you wait.”</p>

<p>But the envious Badeg, looking on,
scoffed aloud, saying, “<em>I</em> know how to
make a fortune without waiting at all!”</p>

<h3>Nevertheless, much depends on a man’s horoscope.
One is born in the desert, and becomes a
brigand; another is reared in the great city, and
publishes books. It is Kismet.—<em>Ben Haround.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">A splendid</span> retinue attended the
virtuous Kayenna, the highborn
Prince Muley, and the
Sage Shacabac, as they set out at sunrise
of the next day, from the gates
of Ubikwi, on the long and toilsome
journey to Nhulpar. Muley Mustapha
watched them with tearful eyes, not
knowing when, if ever, they might
return, nor what might be the event of
their enterprise; still less—and this concerned
him most sorely—what would
become of him in their absence. Nor
were his forebodings lightened when he
beheld the astrologer Badeg grinning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
malevolently at the departing caravan.
He would have been even more disturbed
in mind, had he seen the latter, as
the cavalcade was setting forth, pluck
the sleeve of Shacabac, and heard him
whisper the fateful words: “You asked
me what omen was more malign than
any of those you named. I will tell
you. It is to cheat a mighty Sultan
and try to cheat a mightier King <em>by
palming off a Princess for a Prince</em>!”</p>
<br>

  <img class="w100" src="images/p062.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">
<p><em>Ben Zoin</em></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Pale with mingled anger and astonishment,
Shacabac rode his camel beside
that of Kayenna, and, begging a private
interview, hastily confided to her the
malignant words of the astrologer.
The brow of the fair lady darkened as
much as a brow so fair could lose its
alabaster hue. Then, summoning her
chief of staff, she said to him, “Hark
ye, Ben Zoin, trusty servant of my
royal father, take at once twenty of
your best lances, and, when we shall
have reached the well of Al-kohol, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>the caravan is in bivouac, steal forth
with them, letting no man know it but
yourselves, and ride as for your lives
to the capital of Kopaul. Demand
immediate audience of the Sultan,—this
signet ring will admit you at any
hour,—tell him that there is treason in
Ubikwi. Bid him summon his forces,
and march at once to the relief of my
husband. Should he find the rebels
contumacious and able to withstand
him, let him say to them that Kayenna
of Ubikwi, with her son, the Heir
Apparent of Nhulpar, and an hundred
thousand spears, will be at the gates
ere the waning of another moon. Go,
and be silent; for traitors may be in
this caravan also.”</p>

<p>The bearded, black-browed Ben Zoin
bowed as he took the sacred signet, and
promised to be at the capital of Kopaul
as speedily as camel might carry him.</p>

<p>“Thou didst well to tell me of that
caitiff’s words, good Shacabac,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
Kayenna, graciously; “and, though
thou art not over-clever in all things, yet
I believe thee honest in most. For this
act thou mayst find thyself one day
Grand Vizier of three realms, an thou
diest not of thy weight of wisdom in
the mean time.”</p>

<p>Laughing gayly as the caravan presently
came in sight of the oasis of
Al-kohol, she gave the order to camp
for the night. But ere the second
hour of encampment had passed, Ben
Zoin and a score of the best lances in
the cavalcade had stolen noiselessly out
of the enclosure; and none were missed
until the morning’s muster.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Where is my trusty Ben Zoin?”
asked Kayenna, when the caravan was
forming in order of march. Shacabac
was so surprised at the question,
knowing what he knew, that he was on
the point of explaining to her, when a
look from her keen eyes closed his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>“God is great,” he muttered to himself.
“Of a verity, I am becoming an
imbecile; or, mayhap, I have been one
all my life without knowing it. If so,
Allah be praised! there is yet some
hope for me; for he who beginneth to
understand himself hath at least reached
the outer portals of Knowledge. But
what an actress she is!”</p>

<p>Nobody seemed able to answer the
question propounded so simply. The
captains of the guard, all old soldiers
and comrades of the missing warrior,
said that they knew not how to explain
his absence.</p>

<p>“He may have gone reconnoitring,”
said one.</p>

<p>“Some mischance hath surely befallen
him in the night,” said another.</p>

<p>“An evil genie may have spirited
away him and his companions,” said a
third, who was brave, but imaginative,
and suspected of composing poetry in
his hours off duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“Most likely he hath proven traitor,
and deserted,” said the voice of another,
who was not of the old guard.</p>

<p>“Ha! what sayest thou?” cried Kayenna.
“Come hither. Thy words are
ominous. Come to my tent at noonday,
and we will inquire further. This
disappearance must be explained.”</p>

<p>Nothing more was heard of the missing
soldier and his fellows; and the
caravan, much disturbed in mind, halted
at noon by the oasis of Rhi, near to the
wells of Bûrbon, famed for the exhilarating
quality of their waters.</p>

<p>“And so thou hast reason to apprehend
that Ben Zoin and his men have
deserted the caravan of the Pasha’s
wife, being traitors or cowards?”
queried Kayenna of the man who had
suggested that explanation at the morning
muster.</p>

<p>“No,” stammered the man: “I have
no reason, only that it <em>stands</em> to reason
that they could not have gone away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
save of their free will; and what else
could they be but traitors if they”—</p>

<p>“Strange,” mused Kayenna, “that an
honest man never suspects his neighbor
of being a knave, while a rascal is ever
distrustful. But suspicion is like a
plague. Once started, it attacks all.
<em>I</em> even have caught the infection, and
cannot withhold my suspicions of this
worthy fellow. Let him be searched
forthwith, so that my unjust thoughts
of him may be forever dispelled.”</p>

<p>So, in despite of his protestations
and even vigorous resistance, he was
promptly stripped; and, lo! within the
lining of his caftan was found a scroll
of parchment addressed to his Majesty,
the King of Nhulpar.</p>

<p>“I did not know,” said Kayenna,
“that we had in our retinue a bearer of
dispatches to the sovereign whom we
are about to visit. From our worthy
lord, mayhap?”</p>

<p>The poor wretch only shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>“Not, perchance, from our royal
father, of Kopaul?”</p>

<p>The captive groaned.</p>

<p>“Then, as it does not appear to be
a privileged communication, I will take
the liberty of inspecting its contents.
Meanwhile, Shacabac, you will bear
witness that I have the messenger’s permission
to examine the document.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, she had not that
permission; but the last man on earth
to challenge the statement at that moment
was the poor wretch pinioned by
two stout guards and overshadowed by
the giant form of Al Choppah, who,
without understanding a word that was
said, grinned anticipatively, as a conscientious
sinecure might, at the thought
of doing something, however trifling, in
the line of duty.</p>

<p>“To his Most Puissant Majesty,
the Mighty King of Nhulpar,” read
Kayenna, as she unrolled the scroll,
“from Badeg, Astrologer-in-chief to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
the Court of Ubikwi, in prospective to
the Court of Kopaul, and in humble
hope to the Royal Court of Nhulpar,
these:</p>

<p>“I take this opportunity to inform
your most gracious Majesty that the
caravan which sets forth this day for
your royal court goes upon a wicked
and deceitful errand; namely, to impose
upon your Majesty.”</p>

<p>“That is enough,” said Kayenna, refolding
the scroll. “I see that thy
master has been good enough to cast
the horoscope of the King of Nhulpar;
and a very pretty one it is. Pray tell
me, has he cast thine, also? No!
Well, let me do it for thee. It is not
a very bright one; but it hath this
advantage over even more auspicious
predictions, that it is absolutely and irrevocably
true. I do not need to know
under what planet or conjunction of
the stars thou wast born, nor in what
‘house’ a single sign of the zodiac was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
domiciled on that unlucky day. Thy
fortune began with the moment when
thou didst accept the commission of
that villain Badeg to play the spy and
traitor on this caravan, and it will end
ere the sun set on another day. Hast
ever heard of the two-headed Snake of
Rhi, the horrible monster with a venomous
mouth at either end of his body,
wherewith he devours his prey? What?
Badeg forgot to mention that trifling
wonder to thee? What a dull knave
he is to set himself up for an astrologer!
In a little while thou shalt know
more than he has learned in all his life;
but the knowledge will not abide with
thee so long, perchance. Ho there, Al
Choppah, put up thy scimitar! There
is rarer sport here. To-morrow there
shall be a treat for the caravan and the
two-headed Snake of Rhi.</p>

<p>“This two-headed serpent,” explained
Kayenna, carelessly, to Shacabac,
“is a rare monster which delighteth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
in flinging himself bodily on his prey,
striking it with the middle of his
length, then tightening himself, fold on
fold, around the victim, until, life being
all but crushed out, he feasts with his
double heads on the dying body. I
care little for such spectacles myself,
for I think they savor of the grotesque;
but it will amuse our caravan,
and make a weary hour pass
pleasantly.”</p>

The Sage, after bidding his body-servants

be in such woful plight. The outcast
replied in the Lingua Franca dialect:
“Truly, because I could not resist the
inducement of a free ride from
Nhulpar to Ubikwi; but the
people of my caravan deserted
me in the wilderness two days
since, and I have been in sore
straits to reach this oasis.”</p>

<p>“And what was thy business
in Ubikwi?” asked the Sage.</p>

<p>“None whatever,” replied
the stranger; “but it was a free
ride,—have I not told thee so?—and
of course
I went along.”</p>

responded Shacabac, “thou art more
likely to prove erelong that thou dost

of the deadheads.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he was so moved by
the piteous condition of the stranger
that he allowed him to join the caravan
and lead a pack-camel every day during
the rest of the march. And the Sage
wrote upon his tablets this precious
aphorism: “The free lunch is for the
thirsty, not for the hungry.”</p>

<p>A happy thought now occurred to
Shacabac, and he said:—</p>

<p>“The two-headed Snake is a beautiful
instrument of justice; but, if your
Highness will pardon her slave for offering
a suggestion, I think that the penalty
is a trifle too short-lived. The crime deserves
a more prolonged punishment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>“That is true,” rejoined Kayenna;
“but, unfortunately, we omitted to
bring the Court Torturer with us on
this journey, and we can ill afford to
waste precious time in mere diversion.
Nevertheless, if you think of any device
which may serve to enliven the
noon hour of rest, do not hesitate to
speak. I feel in a kindly mood toward
all the world at present, and would not
rob so true a friend as yourself of any
innocent pleasure.”</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, Shacabac proposed
that the stranger whom the caravan had
picked up by the oasis of Rhi should
be sent for, and interrogated concerning
the criminal jurisprudence of his outlandish
country beyond the Western
Ocean.</p>

<p>Kayenna was pleased to look graciously
upon the suggestion, and immediately
despatched a slave in search
of the stranger, who promptly appeared
at the entrance of the pavilion of state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>Great was the surprise of Shacabac
on beholding the transformation which
had occurred in the appearance of the
man, but a few days agone the most
forlorn outcast in all the land. From
the rich folds of his jewelled turban to
the red tips of his Levantine slippers,
the whilom vagrant was attired in
splendid raiment, and bore himself with
that dignity which in Occidental lands
marks the owner of sumptuous apparel.
Shacabac, whose keen eyes took note
of all things, quickly recognized the
habiliments before him.</p>

<p>“Amrou’s turban,” he said to himself,
making a mental inventory,
“Cassim’s slippers, and Selim’s caftan!
That is the scimitar of Sokum, resting
in the sash of Tippoo, the Congo porter,
beside, as I live, the yataghan
which I myself did foolishly wager but
yester eve on the fall of an idle card!
An this keep on, the rascal will own the
whole caravan ere we reach Nhulpar.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>For, by some necromancy known to
his barbarian countrymen, the stranger
had learned to control the fortuitous
movements of inanimate pieces of
pasteboard, so that they fell ever as he
listed, but always contrary to the wishes
of the true believer, who vainly challenged
fate on what seemed a certain
result. Allah alone knoweth how such
prodigies are permitted to come to pass.</p>

<p>Stifling his anger at this last outrage,
because of Kayenna’s presence, he bade
the stranger kneel at the feet of her
Highness, and affably addressed him
as follows:—</p>

<p>“Dog of an unbeliever and scum of
the saliva of jackals, her most gracious
Highness deigns to ask of thee in what
way do thy obscene countrymen punish
a knave guilty of high treason against
the mockery which they miscall a government.”</p>

<p>Whereunto the outcast replied,
“Which?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>“It is not a question of Which or of
What,” said Shacabac, severely, “but
of How. In what way do the misguided
infidels of your country treat
their desperate criminals? for I suppose
that not all of them are permitted to
escape justice, and flee to more blessed
lands, wherein they are enabled to despoil
the followers of the Prophet.”</p>
<br>

  <img class="w100" src="images/p078.jpg" alt="Men playing cards">
</figure>
<br>

<p>“In grave cases,” said the stranger,
after a moment’s reflection, “when the
accused has neither friends nor money
nor influence, he is subjected
to preliminary torture at the
hands of what we call the Interviewers.
Often he is present
in person during the ordeal;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
but that is largely optional with him,
and wholly so with them. In practice
it has been found that the most satisfactory
interviews are conducted in the
absence of the subject. It is a matter
of taste and convenience. The real
ordeal begins when the prisoner is subjected
to the Process of Lor.”</p>

<p>“And what is that?” asked Kayenna
and Shacabac, as with one breath.</p>

<p>“It is a complicated process,” was
the answer, “but highly instructive.
In the first place, the judge, or Cadi, as
you would call him, orders twelve men,
who know nothing about the case,—otherwise
they would not be selected,—to
be arrested and imprisoned until the
guilt or innocence of the accused can
be established. Absolute ignorance of
the question is the prime essential governing
the selection of the twelve; but
total ignorance of everything constitutes
the ideal qualification of what we
call a ‘juror.’ The less the jurors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
know or are capable of knowing, the
greater the probability that they will
speedily agree upon a verdict. It is
a very wise and ancient provision of
Lor,” added the stranger, reverently;
“for, if it were something foolish and
new-fangled, it would seem impossible
that any twelve men of intelligence
could agree unanimously upon a question
so intricate as those which are
usually brought before our juries.
Happily, however, the jurors are not
supposed to be intelligent; and, consequently,
they nearly always agree upon
a matter concerning which any two of
them would scarcely be found in accord
outside of the sacred jury-room.”</p>

<p>“But, when they have agreed,” interposed
Kayenna, who had a mind
for things concrete, “what happens to
the criminal?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the criminal!” responded the
stranger: “he is put under restraint at
the beginning of the proceedings, as are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
the witnesses also, if there be any; but
that depends upon whether or not they
be able to furnish securities for their
appearance in court.”</p>

<p>“It is a strange system, this administration
of Lor, as you call it,” said
Kayenna, not without some suspicion
that the stranger was indulging in romance;
“but tell me in a word, does
it never <em>punish</em> anybody?”</p>

<p>“Does it?” ejaculated the stranger.
“Well, I should say it does. It punishes
everybody,—the jurors, the judge,
the witnesses, the people who have to
hear or read the proceedings of the
court, the citizens who have to pay
for all the business. Why, even the
prisoner himself is sometimes punished,
and always more or less annoyed
by the procrastination and uncertainty
of the whole affair. There are times in
the life of such a man when he almost
feels that Lor itself is a failure. Of
course, he has his consolation, such as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
it is, in the flowers and sweetmeats and
love-poems sent to him by non-resident
members of Female Asylums for
the Feeble-minded, once he is found
guilty of a dazzling crime; but what
are flowers or candy or poetry to a
man who feels that he is losing time
which might be homicidally valuable to
himself and society, under different
circumstances?”</p>

<p>The stranger spoke with some heat,
as one who might have himself experienced
the sad uncertainty of Lor;
but Kayenna, with her logical mind,
brought him quickly back to the main
point.</p>

<p>“You say,” said she, “that the criminal
is sometimes punished. Describe
the process of capital execution.”</p>

<p>“It varies,” responded the stranger,
“in the different sections of my country.
In some places the condemned is
strangled: in others he is imprisoned
‘for life,’ but usually pardoned after a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
few years. In the State where I last
dwelt they have introduced the fashion
of electrocution; that is to say, of killing
the victim by electricity.”</p>

<p>“And how is that done?” queried
Kayenna, always interested in anything
savoring of novelty.</p>

<p>“I fear I cannot explain it clearly
without the aid of a Brush generator
or a dynamo of some kind, and I do
not see anything of the sort hereabout.
But your Highness no doubt has often
seen the effects of a thunder-storm
whereby somebody was slain, in the
twinkling of an eye as it were. It is
thus that we destroy such of our criminals
as outlive the Process of Lor.”</p>

<p>“What doth the knave mean?”
asked Kayenna, with a frown, aside to
Shacabac.</p>

<p>“It passeth my comprehension,” was
the reply, “but I fear me the dog
laugheth at our faces; for how can any
man call down lightning from heaven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
to destroy his enemies?” Then, addressing
the stranger, he asked sternly:
“Hath this divinity of thine—this not
very infallible Lor—command of the
forces of nature, so that it can at will
draw down the thunderbolt wherewith
to smite its victims? Thy tale is wondrous
strange. Her Highness would
fain see a proof of it. Take out the
culprit, guilty of high treason but yesterday,
and let him be ‘electrocuted,’
as thou callest it, before our eyes. Say
I not right?” he added, turning toward
Kayenna.</p>

<p>“Thou sayest but what is right and
just,” was the prompt response; “and
I confess that I am interested in seeing
the operation of this invention so
strangely chanced upon by ignorant
unbelievers. Go on, stranger. The
victim is ready. Let us see thee electrocute
him forthwith.”</p>

<p>But, as obedience to that command
was wholly beyond the stranger and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
as he could not give a satisfactory or
intelligible explanation of his inability
to obey, Kayenna became exceedingly
wroth; and, being moreover a good
deal tired of his long and tedious disquisition
on Lor, she settled the matter
summarily by saying: “This stranger
is an impostor who hath doubtless fled
from the rude justice of his own country.
Let him be cast, along with the
traitor, into the cave of the two-headed
Snake; and thus let there be an end to
all knaves and liars!”</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="p085" style="max-width: 44.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p085.jpg" alt="Camels">
</figure>
<br>

<p>This sentence being communicated
to the American,
he fell at the feet of Kayenna,
and begged as a dying request
that his picture might be taken
before execution. On being
asked why he desired that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
such a crime against the law of Moses
as well as of Mohammed should be
perpetrated, he only answered, in a
somewhat incoherent fashion, “so that
it might appear in the papers.”</p>

<p>“But knowest thou not,” said Kayenna,
sternly, “that it is forbidden by
thy law, as by ours, to make a graven
image or likeness of any living thing?”</p>

<p>“O Lord!” wailed the unhappy
man, “surely a newspaper picture does
not come under that head! But take
me away,” he added despairingly.
“People who never heard of electrocution
cannot be expected to appreciate
electrotypes.”</p>

<p>So he was borne to his dungeon;
and in a short time four stalwart slaves
thrust him, along with the condemned
traitor, into the mouth of the cave of
the horrible two-headed Snake, there
to suffer the most cruel death ever conceived
of by mortal mind.</p>

<p>But mortal mind erred, at least for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
once. On visiting the cave next morning,
the executioners found not a trace
of the two culprits, wherefore they supposed
that the snake had despatched
them promptly.</p>

<p>But the snake also was missing, and
the closest search disclosed no explanation
of his absence.</p>

<p>The mystery was partially solved
when the caravan reached the capital of
Nhulpar a few days later, and was confronted
at the very gates of the city
with flaming placards announcing that</p>

<h3>There are times when it is inexpedient, if not
actually immoral, to kill the bediamonded clerk of a
caravansary.—<em>Manco Capac.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Kayenna</span> was at first deeply
incensed on reading those advertisements,
and would fain
have invoked the assistance of the King
of Nhulpar to punish the culprit; but
Shacabac sagely counselled her, saying:
“Let it be. If the people of Nhulpar
believe in this two-headed Snake, all
the more will they reverence thee who
art supposed to own others of the
kind; and meanwhile the terror of thy
name shall be spread throughout the
earth. But [he added to himself] I
would that I had the knave who defrauded
me of my trusty yataghan, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
knew the secret whereby he made his
cards fall as he willed. Great is Philosophy,
and marvellous is Science;
but miraculous is this thing which the
Giaours call ‘Luck.’ Methinks it
hath more to do with Science than with
Philosophy. Would that the knave
had stayed with me long enough to
explain the strange mutations of that
mysterious game which he calleth
Po-kah!”</p>

<p>But ere this had come to pass, and
while the caravan was crossing a sandy,
waterless stretch of desert, Kayenna
summoned the Sage to her side, and,
smiling in a knowing way, asked,
“Hast thou, in thy long experience,
ever heard of a more difficult problem
than that which confronts us, or a device
whereby such a grave difficulty
might be overcome?”</p>

<p>Shacabac had by this time conceived
a profound respect for the genius of
Kayenna; yet he could not imagine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
any stratagem by which she might extricate
herself and him and the fortunes
of Ubikwi and Kopaul from the impending
dilemma. “Nay,” he answered
modestly, “I have heard of
many, but of none so intricate as this.
And I own that my heart weighs
heavier with every step of our journey.
Will not your Highness deign to tell
her meanest slave how she purposes
to carry us in safety to Nhulpar and
home again, with our heads on our
shoulders?”</p>

<p>“O Shacabac,” laughed Kayenna,
“thou art only a man, after all, and a
bachelor at that. Hast never heard
of even a man’s outwitting another,
not to speak of the endless resources
of his superior, Woman?”</p>

<p>A little piqued at this sally, Shacabac
replied: “Truly, I have known of
some such; but they were all as child’s
play compared with this coil. There
was the case of the Ameer of Khali-Mazu,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
who, being secretly envious of
the great Sultan Djambhori, sought to
compass his ruin by a gift of twoscore
large and healthy elephants, the bare
feeding of which for one twelvemonth
would have emptied the royal exchequer.
To have sold or given away
the animals would have been a grave
discourtesy.”</p>

<p>“That was rather a pretty dilemma,”
admitted Kayenna. “How did Djambhori
escape it?”</p>

<p>“He escaped it,” replied Shacabac,
“by having the animals quietly despatched,
and their tusks made into
keys for twoscore grand pianos, the
which he sent as presents to the wives
of the Ameer, thus nobly revenging
the wrong that had been done him.
The Ameer, struck with remorse on
perceiving the magnanimity of his foe,
committed suicide shortly after the arrival
of the pianos, and while the harem
yet resounded with the practice lessons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
of his devoted wives. The incident,”
added Shacabac, “attracted much attention
at the time, and led to the strict
laws since passed against the importation
of elephants and pianos into Khali-Mazu.”</p>

<p>“Verily, the device was ingenious,”
commented Kayenna; “but it hardly
matches what is required of us in a few
days hence. Hast thou ever heard of
a youth so situated that he could not
fill any office in the land, yet rising to
the highest, and that, too, without awakening
the hostility of a single human
being, notwithstanding the fierce jealousy
which assails even those of lofty
rank when they aim for rank yet
higher?”</p>

<p>“Never,” answered Shacabac, “unless
[bethinking himself of one remarkable
exception]—unless it be that of
Dar-Khos, a slave who once attained
by a single stroke to boundless wealth,
high rank, and length of days, merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
by refusing to obey the commands
of his master, the great Sultan Al-Kali.”</p>

<p>“That sounds interesting,” said Kayenna;
“and how did it happen?”</p>

<p>“In this wise,” responded Shacabac.
“The Sultan and his slave, travelling
without escort, came to a deep and wide
river; and the Sultan ordered Dar-Khos
to go forward and ford the stream.
‘Nay,’ answered the slave, with great
humility, ‘the dog followeth his master.’
Being pleased with which reply,
the Sultan plunged into the stream, and
presently sank in a quicksand, so that
naught of him was visible save only his
turban, in which he had hidden, for
greater security, the crown jewels and
other valuables. These, with great difficulty,
did Dar-Khos rescue, and by
judiciously investing them was enabled
to secure the nomination and election
to the vacant sultanship. And the
moral thereof is, A drowned man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
dreadeth the water, but a wise one
shunneth it from the beginning.”</p>

<p>“Thy tale is amusing,” commented
Kayenna, “and the moral is as irrelevant
as a moral should be; but both are
far and wide from the purport of my
question: How is a poor, weak woman
to soothe the chagrin and placate the
anger of two mighty monarchs, when
they find that nature hath been greater
than herself and they together?”</p>

<p>But Shacabac had naught to answer;
for, indeed, the same problem had been
puzzling his head for many days, and
making that head seem to fit very
loosely on his shoulders. It was a sad
business all round; and he cursed the
hour in which he had been tempted
from his scholarly seclusion to aid in
the wild schemes of a desperate woman;
saying to himself, “A bird on toast is
worth two on a bonnet,” which indeed
is a truth that any child might comprehend.</p>

<h3>Surely, thou dost not expect strangers to pay for
thy books. And, surely, thou wouldst not ask thy
friends to buy them. Seek some other way of achieving
wealth through letters. And let me know if
thou findest it.—<em>The Pauper Poet.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Right</span> royal was the welcome
given to the caravan and its
illustrious passengers on reaching
the suburbs of the capital of Nhulpar.
Imposing ranks of soldiery, horse
and foot, lined both sides of the broad
road for at least five miles without the
gates. On entering the city, they found
the streets carpeted with roses, hung
on both sides with gorgeous banners,
and canopied with evergreen arches
spangled with flowers of every hue.</p>

<p>Before coming into the presence of
the king, they were treated to a rare
feast of intellect. First, a chorus of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
ten thousand school-children, attired in
white, sang a hymn of welcome, consisting
of three hundred and forty
stanzas, each replete with a tender
thought or dainty conceit. Then followed
an address from the chief men
of the city, setting forth at much length
the ancient friendship existing between
the two nations,—a friendship which
was now about to be cemented more
firmly than ever. With great felicity
and originality of thought the speaker
pointed out that the people of Ubikwi
and the people of Nhulpar were of
the same origin, speaking the same
language, that of Omar and Abdullah.
“We must be friends,” he said, “for
the sake of our common blood, our
common language, and the common
Koran which teaches us all. A quarrel
between two such peoples would be a
crime against humanity.”</p>

<p>If the speaker overlooked the fact
that such crimes had been committed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
once or twice already, with the enthusiastic
consent of both parties, that was
neither here nor there. The sentence
was well turned, and that is enough
to expect of a state oration.</p>

<p>Kayenna and her suite, most
of them being mutes, listened
with rare courtesy and patience
to the addresses which followed;
but Shacabac, who had not yet
broken his fast,—and it was
now high noon,—was visibly
and audibly wearied by the ceremonies,
and devoted one hundred
and sixty-three pages of
his inimitable diary to a scathing
denunciation of the vice of
prolixity.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="p097" style="max-width: 48.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p097.jpg" alt="Horse pulling cart load of men">
</figure>

<br>
<p>There were addresses from</p>

<p>The Incorporated Association
of Muezzins;</p>

<p>The Imaum Brotherhood;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>The Dancing Dervishes, who spoke
as well as danced;</p>

<p>The Santon Society;</p>

<p>The Ancient Order of Arabian
Knights, one thousand and one strong,
each in turn relating a sprightly anecdote;</p>

<p>The Brethren of Backsheesh, numerous
and influential;</p>

<p>The Camel Drivers’ Association;</p>

<p>The Fraternity of Water Carriers;</p>

<p>Thirty-two ex-presidents of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, seated in a beautiful chariot
drawn by a cream-white pony;</p>

<p>Citizens generally.</p>

<p>Following these came interesting
songs and recitations by local talent,
all encored. Nor was the impatience
of Shacabac relieved when a portly personage
in spectacles was introduced by
the presiding officer as “the far-famed
and immortal Ben Haround, the Pauper
Poet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>“Truly, a tautological title,” murmured
the Sage, as the bard, stepping
forward, proceeded to unroll many
lengths of an ode written for the occasion,
or for any occasion, and respectfully
dedicated to the illustrious Prince
of Ubikwi. The verses, unfortunately,
have not been preserved, notwithstanding
that the Poet presented to Kayenna
a copy beautifully woven in silk,
and distributed among the throng several
thousand other copies printed on
a cheaper material. Ben Haround’s
works had a large circulation during
his lifetime; but his zeal in disseminating
those gems of poesy kept him constantly
poor, whence came his title of
the Pauper Poet, to distinguish him
from the opulent bards of other lands.</p>

<p>This being the first visit of the Ubikwians
to Nhulpar, several youths in
brazen armor, bearing tablets and writing
instruments, pressed forward at this
point, and, respectfully accosting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
strangers, begged to be informed regarding
their “impressions of the
country.”</p>

<p>Happily, at this juncture, the King
himself rode up, and averted an international
quarrel by ordering the indiscreet
youths to be immersed in a
caldron of brine for the next twenty-four
hours. Then, courteously welcoming
his guests, he gave order that the
feast should be spread.</p>

<p>The King of Nhulpar sat at the
head of the banquet table. On his
left sat Kayenna; beside her the lovely
daughter of the King, and at her side
the child whom all believed to be the
son of Muley Mustapha. Shacabac
was awarded a place on the opposite
side of the table, next to the favorite
spouse of Nhulpar, the mother of the
intended bride. Women are not commonly
admitted to share in the feasts
of state; but exception had to be made
in the case of Kayenna, and the others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
were allowed to keep her countenance,—a
provision entirely unnecessary with
her.</p>

<p>Shacabac vainly endeavored
to catch her eye and
signal a warning, when he
perceived, to his dismay,
that the Princess of Nhulpar
was engaged in animated
discourse with the
potential cause of all future
trouble, the Prince of
Ubikwi, who, in truth,
bore his assumed honors
with becoming gallantry.
Never, indeed, had a genuine
prince carried himself
with more debonair grace.</p>

<p>The illusion was perfect,
so that even hardened,
old courtiers exchanged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
furtive winks and nudges, as who should
say, “Our coming King hath a merry
way with the women, and will not lose
his bride for lack of brave wooing!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Kayenna and the King
kept up a gay conversation. The royal
mother beamed approval on the young
people, and indulged in the original remark
to the Sage that “Heaven made
and hath matched them,” whereat Shacabac,
stifling a groan, smiled a courtier’s
smile and murmured assent.</p>

<p>After the feast there were speeches,
dignified, gracious, affectionate, and not
too brief; but Shacabac had broken his
fast, and feared naught that fate might
bring until—until it brought the worst,—discovery,
discomfiture and ruin.</p>

<p>“The nuptials will be celebrated at
sunset,” said Kayenna to him as the
wedding dinner ended, and the ladies
retired to their apartments to prepare
for the great festivities.</p>

<p>“But, Great Allah,” he exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
in horror, “do you know what then?
Unless something happens, we are
lost,—thou, I, the gentle Princess,
thy daughter”—</p>

<p>“Have no fear, good Shacabac,” she
replied smilingly: “something <em>will</em> happen
ere thou knowest it.” Again she
smiled, the smile of confidence or of
fatuity, he could not tell which, and
moved away in the bridal train.</p>

<p>And something did happen,—something
not down on the programme of
King or Queen, Sage or Soothsayer.
As the last of the retinue disappeared
behind the hangings, a trumpet-blast
was heard without the court, and a messenger,
who had evidently ridden in hot
haste, was admitted to the royal presence.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” he said, bending
low, “I bring evil news. There is
trouble in Ubikwi. The great Pasha
Muley Mustapha is besieged in his
palace by a rebel rabble, led by a scurvy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
Soothsayer, and, unless help be sent to
him forthwith, woe to him and his
household, and to all the friends of
Ubikwi!”</p>

<p>The King of Nhulpar, as we have
said, was a warrior who loved the music
of battle. The sound of clashing arms
was sweet to his ears, and the savor of
blood was as fragrance to his nostrils.
The call to action came at an opportune
moment; for the preparations of
the past weeks had been a burden to
his soul, which liked not the effeminate
adjuncts of matrimony.</p>

<p>“Ha, sayst thou so?” he exclaimed.
“Then, by the beard of the Prophet,
thy words are welcome. I would fain
see how this stripling, my son-in-law
and heir to be, can bear himself in the
lists of war. He seemeth over-confident
in those of love, for one of such
stern stuff as the King of Nhulpar
should be. Here, slave, go to the
apartments of the Prince of Ubikwi,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>and say to him that the King beseeches
his company on a pleasant joust. Bid
the wedding guests await our return,
which may be anon or later.”</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>“Allah help our Kayenna now and
her bantling!” exclaimed Shacabac to
himself, as the warlike preparations
went on. “I can but join the cavalcade,
though little stomach have I for
blows and blood. Nathless, I think
that my head will be safer at Ubikwi
than before the jaws of this battle-loving
king. Verily, the sandal-maker
should stick to his sandal-wood, and
the man of wisdom to his preaching,
leaving to fools the dangerous work of
practising the same.”</p>

<br>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> courier told only the truth.
Dark and dangerous times had
befallen poor old Muley Mustapha
in his lonely palace of Ubikwi.
For days he had wandered disconsolate
through the zenana, missing the presence
of Kayenna, which had ever been
as the cooling east wind to his fevered
brow; missing Shacabac, whose words
of wisdom had so often wooed him to
repose; missing Al Choppah and his
diverting bowstring and scimitar that
had enlivened many a long hour.</p>

<p>He did not miss little Muley; for, of
a truth, he had seldom laid eyes upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
the offspring whom he unjustly blamed
as the cause of all his woes. And now,
when he strayed into the child’s sleeping-room,
he noted with a shocked
sense of the incongruous how it was
decorated with the toys and the arms
of virility,—ghastly relics of the futile
attempt to deceive his people and the
people of two greater nations!</p>

<p>“If she had never been born! If
she had had the good taste to die any
time during the past miserable eighteen
years! If that villanous old Soothsayer”—</p>

<p>Here he was startled by a voice
at his elbow,—“Your Highness was
pleased to allude to <em>me</em>?”</p>

<p>It was the new Soothsayer, Badeg,
looking, if possible, more impudently
familiar than ever.</p>

<p>Muley Mustapha plucked up a spirit.
“No, I was not alluding to you; though
I <em>was</em> thinking of a villanous Soothsayer—an
old one—who went to his reward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
long ago. But what in the name of
Eblis is it to you?”</p>
<br>

  <img class="w100" src="images/p108a.jpg" alt="Toy soldier">
</figure>
<br>

<p>“Nothing,—oh, nothing,” was the
bland reply. Then, after a pause:
“Perchance your Highness was
thinking of the great Astrologer
Kibosh, who rose from the sorry
condition of a beggarly carter to
the highest favor in his master’s
eyes because of a secret which
he once discovered. He went
to his reward many years ago,
as your Highness hath said;
but his secret died not with him,
and it is said to be even more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>wondrous than that possessed by the
Wise Man who could change base
metal into shining gold, inasmuch as
the possessor of it hath no need to buy
even the base metal, for”—here the
speaker paused and looked significantly
at the Pasha—“he findeth it right before
him and ready to his hand.”</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>Muley Mustapha, trying to dissemble
and not succeeding very well,
answered with assumed carelessness:
“Truly, that must have been a remarkable
man. I do not remember having
heard of him before. What didst thou
say he was when he led an honest life?”</p>

<p>“He was a poor carter,” replied the
Soothsayer, “and, though he worked
hard every day, and was very thrifty in
his habits, yet he found himself growing
poorer day by day and year by
year. For he had a large family, consisting
of seven sons and six daughters,
whose respective ages were 13, 12, 11,
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
no easy task to feed those thirteen jaws,
or I should say pairs of jaws, without
counting those of himself and his patient
wife.</p>

<p>“Howbeit, it happened that Kibosh,
on a certain Friday morning, awoke rejoicing
that it was the day of rest, yet
murmuring that, such being the fact, he
knew there would be for him no work
that day whereby to earn food for the
morrow. He sat up in his couch,
yawned, sighed, arose, and put on his
garments. Then, after saying his morning
prayers and making his scanty
toilet, he sat down to a humble meal
of black bread and dates. The bread
was old and hard, and the dates were
dry. Kibosh groaned as he chewed the
uninviting food between his two-and-thirty
teeth.”</p>

<p>“Had he two-and-thirty teeth?” interrupted
the Pasha.</p>

<p>“Truly, he had no more,” replied the
narrator. “It is the exact number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
possessed by all men of ripe years,
unless, indeed, they have lost one or
more.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the Pasha, “what was
there remarkable in his having that
number?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” was the answer, in a
tone of scarcely veiled impertinence.
“Only <em>I</em> am telling the story; and I
am trying to tell it in the only proper
style, which is the Realistic. Is it your
Highness’s wish that I proceed?”</p>

<p>“By all means,” said Muley Mustapha;
“but, before going any further,
how many hands had this Kibosh?”</p>

<p>“I was about to come to that,” returned
the Soothsayer, tranquilly. “He
had two hands, on each of which were
one thumb and four fingers. He had
likewise two feet, with five toes on each.
This being a true story, I will not attempt
to conceal the fact that he was
furthermore blessed with two eyes, the
like number of ears, one nose and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
mouth, and as many hairs on his head
and chin as might be; for these I did
not try to enumerate.</p>

<p>“Having finished his frugal meal and
smoked his chibouk, Kibosh went to
the mosque, like a good Mussulman.
His wife, the faithful Zaidee, remained
at home. She had many things to do,
attending to the wants of her numerous
offspring, preparing the mid-day meal,
and arranging the thousand little details
of her house for the day. Moreover,
she knew that her attire was hardly meet
for the eyes of strangers. Her next-door
neighbor, Ayesha, the wife of
Hassan, the porter, had but the day before
called on her, attired in a new yashmak,
which was a sore trial to the patience
of Zaidee, it having cost not less
than fifty piastres at the bazaar kept by
Solyman, the one-eyed Hebrew, opposite
the fountain adjacent to the house
of Amrou, the camel-driver.”</p>

<p>Here the Pasha, stifling a yawn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
asked wearily, “How many eyes didst
thou say the Hebrew dog had?”</p>

<p>“One, your Highness. The other,
I believe, was lost in consequence of—”</p>

<p>“It matters not how it was lost,”
said the Pasha, hastily. “Allah be
thanked, it <em>was</em> lost! and thy story
hath some novelty. Go on.”</p>

<p>“For these reasons Zaidee remained
at home while Kibosh went to the
mosque. As it happened, he met on
the way none other than his neighbor,
the porter Hassan; and the two fell
to talking of many things, such as the
weather, the hardness of the times, and
the great cost of bread and dates, and
other such subjects.</p>

<p>“Even as they were speaking, they
were accosted by a poor cripple, who
beseeched alms of them in the name
of Allah. ‘Alas!’ replied Kibosh.
‘I am but a poor man, with a large
family, and can give thee naught save
my prayers.’ But Hassan smiled a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
little haughtily, and, pulling out his
wallet, displayed it full of shining gold
and silver pieces. As he saw the eyes
of Kibosh fixed upon it in wonder, he
hastily closed the wallet, and said, ‘I,
too, am but a poor man,’ and gave the
beggar naught. But, when they had
passed on, Kibosh spoke to Hassan,
saying, ‘O Hassan! but now thou didst
complain of thy poverty; and, lo! thou
hast a purse full of gold and silver.’</p>

<p>“‘It is not mine,’ said Hassan, in
confusion: ‘it is my wife’s.’</p>

<p>“‘But thy wife is as poor as thyself,’
retorted Kibosh, severely; for he
knew that Ayesha was only the daughter
of old Cassim, the tent-maker, who
was as poor as any man in the quarter,
and indeed lived partly on the bounty
of his son-in-law.</p>

<p>“‘Nay, then,’ said Hassan. ‘I will
confess that I found this purse on the
Square last week, and know not who
its owner may be.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>“‘The Square,’ said Kibosh, ‘has
been closed for the past ten days by
order of the Caliph, as thou dost forget;
and neither could any man enter
it to lose or to find a purse. Hassan,
thou art a prevaricator; and I must
denounce thee to the Cadi as a thief
unless—’</p>

<p>“‘Unless what, good neighbor Kibosh?’
cried Hassan, in terror. ‘Surely,
thou wouldst not denounce and ruin
thine old friend!’</p>

<p>“‘Nay,’ said Kibosh; ‘but I would
first know how thou camest into possession
of so vast a sum of money, and
next I would ask thee for a loan of, say,
one-half thereof.’</p>

<p>“Hassan thereupon, being in terror
of his life, confided to Kibosh that he
had become acquainted with a State
Secret to divulge which would be disastrous,
while so long as it remained
unspoken it was a source of liberal
revenue to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>“As soon as Kibosh heard this, he
said, ‘O Hassan, it is now some seventeen
years, or maybe eighteen, that I
have known thee and thy good wife,
Ayesha, and thy father-in-law, Cassim,
not to mention thy son Karib and thy
daughter—’”</p>

<p>“Perish Kibosh and Hassan and all
their tribe!” shrieked the Pasha, leaping
to his feet. “Gehenna be their
portion and thine, thou babbling impostor!
What hath all this to do with
me?”</p>

<p>“What hath it to do with thee?”
answered the astrologer. “Much,
very much, with thee and thine, and
with the people of Ubikwi, and the
people of Kopaul, and the people of
Nhulpar, when they learn that the
secret known to the dead Hassan (for
he died very suddenly that same day)
and confided to Kibosh (also an unhappy
victim of Azrael’s visitation) is
now <em>my</em> secret. Dost wish to hear it?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
Or would your Highness prefer that
I tell it in the market-place, that the
child thou palmest off on the world as
thy ‘son’ is really—”</p>

<p>Muley Mustapha was a meek man.
His critics said behind his back that
he was a hen-pecked man. The whole
world knew that he was an old and
feeble man. But the blood of Ali ran
in his shrivelled veins; and it went boiling
at the insolence of this red-headed
beggar of a star-gazer, who dared beard
him in his own harem. His hand
leaped for his sword, and found only an
empty scabbard; for the peaceable old
Pasha had long ceased to carry the
deadly scimitar, which he had once
been wont to wield in the forefront of
battle. His eyes fell upon the only
weapon in sight, a razor (he afterward
wondered what use there could have
been for it in the harem); and, seizing
it, he shouted in a voice of thunder,
“Out of this, fortune-telling dog, liar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
and humbug, ere I cut the false tongue
out of thy insolent throat!”</p>

<p>The Soothsayer fled from the palace
in terror; but, on gaining the street,
he found his voice again, and began
shrieking aloud that the Pasha had become
mad and was threatening the
lives of all his friends.</p>

<p>“Know ye, O people of Ubikwi,”
he shouted, “that the old man’s sins
have found him out; and Heaven hath
punished him by striking him with
madness, because he hath sinned
against the truth by passing off as his
son a female child born unto him eighteen
years ago!”</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption">
<p class="no-indent">“‘<em>Out of this, fortune-telling dog!</em>’”</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>A large crowd was speedily attracted
by the cries of the Soothsayer; and
they began saying one to another:
“Truly, this holy man cannot be mistaken.
The child Muley hath more of
the woman than of the man about him,
and no eyes have ever seen him engaged
in any manly sport.” And the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>elders, prompted by insinuations previously
sent out by the Soothsayer and
his henchmen, began to remember that
the former Soothsayer had disappeared
mysteriously, together with the Physician,
on the very day of little Muley’s
birth.</p>

<p>Wherefore there arose a great clamor
from the multitude assembled before the
palace; and the old Pasha would have
fared badly that day, had it not been for
the prompt action of a veteran Mameluke
and a dozen or two followers, who,
riding out of the postern gate as if on
patrol duty, set their horses, first at a
gentle canter and then at a sharp gallop,
right into the midst of the throng,
speedily dispersing the unorganized
crowd.</p>

<p>“Hark ye,” said the mustached Captain,
as his Arabian charger reared on
his haunches so that his fore feet almost
touched the shoulders of the Soothsayer,
who fell back some paces in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
haste. “I know nothing of your stars
or your prophecies; but this is the
exercise ground of my troop, and you
have spoiled our manœuvres to-day
by being in the way. Next time we
shall not abate our speed because of
any dirty carcass in our path. Halt!
Form fours! Trot! Gallop!” And
down the esplanade at full speed and
back again went the handful of horsemen,
whose simple creed was obedience
to orders.</p>

<p>Tradition hath it that the grim Captain
of the troop was a renegade Christian,
whose sole redeeming qualities were
that he was loyal to the flag which he
followed for the time, and that he
dearly loved a fight.</p>

<p>The mob was, like all mobs, disconcerted
at first by the organized force of
a disciplined soldiery; and, after a few
vain attempts to carry the palace by
storm, it settled down to besiege and
starve out the garrison,—a decision<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
which vastly pleased the Pasha and his
Mameluke Captain, who shrewdly surmised
that relief would not fail to come
from some quarter if only delay could
be gained. The palace was well supplied
with provisions, for the Pasha
loved good cheer and plenty of it.
Could they but hold their own for a
few weeks, the garrison might laugh at
the efforts of the enemy.</p>

<h3>In time of war begin to prepare for it.—<em>The Compleat
Art of Logistics, by Yang Kee.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> the mighty Sultan of
Kopaul heard of the straits
into which his son-in-law
was driven, he lost no time in beginning
to get ready to prepare to fly,
metaphorically speaking, to his assistance.
Age had somewhat chilled the
ardor of his blood; and in this sudden
crisis he sorely missed the counsels of
his lamented spouse, Paprikah, from
whom the wise Kayenna had inherited
her rare firmness of character. In the
course of many years of conjugal controversy
he had learned to respect her
vigorous intellect and fluency of expression;
but, after her melancholy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
loss, he seemed to lack in some degree
the promptitude of action in emergency
which had been so conspicuous a feature
of his government during her lifetime.
For this lack he made up by a
fecundity and loudness of speech which
impressed all who had not the happiness
of his intimate acquaintance.
With him, as he was wont to say, it
was “a word and a blow.” His critics
sneered that the terms were synonymous,
but they did not understand
the latent resources of the old warrior.</p>

<p>When the time for action came, he
displayed his ability in a way that surprised
them and all the world. In
order not to be embarrassed by the
presence of professional soldiers, who
are ever an annoyance to an administration,
he permitted a thousand of his
veterans to proceed at once with Ben
Zoin to the scene of action, and then
set himself to the more serious work of
planning a great and glorious campaign,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
summoning for the purpose his Minister
of War, in whom he had the highest
confidence.</p>

<p>Between them they formulated a
martial policy which had the unique
distinction of being alike agreeable to
themselves, to the army contractors,
and even to the enemy. Some old-fogy
soldiers, it is true, objected to it
on the last ground; but as most of
them died under its operation, their
voices were not long heard.</p>

<p>A board of strategy, composed of
eminent individuals who, having no experience,
could have no prejudices in
military affairs, resolved upon a line
of action unprecedented in warfare.
Three corps were mobilized and despatched,
after due deliberation, to the
scene of hostilities. The first consisted
of raw levies, hastily organized,
but ably officered by friends and relatives
of the government, men who
had distinguished themselves either by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
political services or by meritorious consanguinity.
The latter were, so to
speak, “born” soldiers.</p>

<p>This first corps was sent to the front
by a special caravan. Their arms and
ammunition were forwarded, some time
later, by a separate route. A third caravan,
following yet another line of
march, transported the food, tents, forage,
and medical supplies.</p>

<p>By this ingenious arrangement the
board of strategy had reason to trust
that all three caravans might reach their
destination in safety and good condition
for effective work. “Divide and
conquer” was the motto. If the soldiers
should be captured, it was reasoned,
their capture would be of no
value to the enemy without the arms,
provisions, and so forth, as would also
the capture of the latter without the
former.</p>

<p>Certain conservative persons, having
a stake in the country, suggested that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
it would be more prudent to keep the
ammunition and commissariat trains at
home until after the arrival of the
troops at the front, so that nothing
more valuable than lives might be lost
in case of any disaster; but there are
captious people who will criticise the
wisest works of man, even historical
works of the most transcendent merit,
which a modest author may not name.
The board of strategy, having a more
than official interest in army contracts,
disregarded such criticisms, saying,
properly enough, that it were better to
lose material which could be replaced, at
government expense, than to hazard
the prospects of future contracts.
Wherein they showed a commendable
forethought and put to shame their
censors, who did not hold any contracts,
present or prospective.</p>

<p>The Sultan had great confidence
also in the reserves, composed of various
military and civil organizations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
distinguished for the splendor of their
uniforms and the vociferousness of their
patriotism in time of peace. As it happened,
their reserve was so pronounced
and shrinking in its character that it
kept them from thrusting themselves
to the front in time of war. Patriotic
Orders, which had vowed to die for their
country many a time, did not forget
their vows when the dread ordeal came,
but, on the contrary, with a fortitude
unequalled in history, chose the most
lingering death that a patriot might
suffer, and voted unanimously to die
of old age for the land which they
loved so well and so wisely. For, as
they truly said: The ignorant soldier
goes and dies for his country, and
thereby ends his usefulness to the country;
but we who stay at home live to
devote ourselves to the country’s service
in any capacity, however lucrative.
Bismillah! they were wise in their generation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>So it was that the mighty Sultan of
Kopaul went to war vicariously, as all
good sovereigns do, and, when it was
over, asked for no greater reward than
a seaport and coaling-station in the
Sahara, where there was no sea and
where a coaling-station was as superfluous
as it would be in Gehenna. Ensued
to his country much glory and
a pension list, which was the wonder
and the envy of the world; for, although
the glory was evanescent, the
pension list endured for generations, and
the seaport and coaling-station served
to “extend the sphere of Kopaulian
influence,” and thus distribute the burden
of taxes, even as a prudent merchant
on the brink of bankruptcy
enlarges the number and amount of
his obligations, on the principle that in
numbers there is safety.</p>

<h3>Every nation has just the government for which
its people are fitted: at least, that is what is said by
the rulers who are piously engaged in misgoverning
it.—<em>Manco Capac.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> Captain of Mamelukes repented
later that he had not
given his charger the treat of
trampling the internal economy out
of the Soothsayer, when, on looking
out of an embrasure of the palace,
he descried a vast mob approaching,
headed by the same Soothsayer, and
brandishing every sort of nondescript
weapon, while they shouted in angry
tones: “Death to the False Pasha!
Death to the Imposter who has deceived
the People with a False Heir!
Death to the foreign Mameluke who
insults our Astrologer!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>“That means me,” said the Mameluke,
grimly. “And it seems to mean
business. I wish I had Ben Zoin and
a dozen of his rough riders behind this
gate to-day. By Allah! we’d teach
those carrion to sing another song.
What is your Highness’s wish?” saluting,
as he spoke, the aged form of
Muley Mustapha. “Shall we comply
with the petition of your royal subjects,
and offer them our heads as a guarantee
of good faith? or let them come
and take them, if they can?”</p>

<p>Muley Mustapha, for answer, only
extended his hand, which the grizzled
warrior took and kissed.</p>

<p>“I take it your Highness does
not mean to part with his head for
nothing?”</p>

<p>A new fire shone in the eyes of
Muley Mustapha. “What my brave
guard does, that and no less will I do,”
he answered. “Let the dogs come on,
if they dare!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>And the dogs came. Did ever a
pack of hounds fear to face the
wounded stag at bay? But dearly did
they pay for their temerity.</p>

<p>For a full hour the unequal combat
raged in front of the feeble gates of the
palace. Foremost at every breach the
bare white locks of Muley Mustapha
were seen, as he wielded his trusty scimitar
and hewed down, one after another,
every foeman who dared face his flaming
countenance. First in every sortie
loomed the gigantic figure of the Captain
of Mamelukes, who seemed to
bear a charmed life, and to escape
death by the very eagerness with which
he courted it, as sometimes happens to
champions in the milder domain of
courtship and love.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the fortune of war had
gone ill with the dauntless few against
the mighty force of numbers, had not
assailants and assailed been startled, at
the very crisis of the conflict, by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
loud notes of a bugle and the sound of
tramping hoofs in the distant streets,
whence presently there emerged, in the
splendid panoply of war, a thousand
of the body-guard of the Sultan of
Kopaul, led on by Ben Zoin, the gallant
champion of Ubikwi.</p>

<p>A ringing cheer went up from the
worn defenders of the palace at sight
of the relief. A wild cry escaped from
the besiegers at the same; but the
false Soothsayer, raising aloft a green
banner, the Prophet’s sacred ensign,
exhorted his followers to fight in the
name of Islam. The fanatical appeal
gave new heart to the rebels, so that
not even the stout lances of Ben Zoin
could have overcome the hostile array,
had there not appeared at the further
gate of the city a new cohort of cavalry,
led by a plumed knight, whose face no
man recognized, as he and his followers,
with levelled spears, thundered
on the rear of the rebel horde.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>The rout of the besiegers
was complete. The
greater part threw down
their arms and cried for
quarter or sought safety
in the alleys and lanes adjacent.
The unknown did
not draw rein until he was
face to face with the Soothsayer,
against whose neck
he levelled the point of his
lance.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="p133" style="max-width: 35.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p133.jpg" alt="Woman on horse">
</figure>
<br>

<p>“By what right, thou
scoundrel,” he thundered,
“dost thou levy war on
the just and mighty Pasha
of Ubikwi? Answer,
knave, ere my steel find an
answer in thy throat!”</p>

<p>Thus forced into a
corner, the insolent Soothsayer,
trusting to his sacred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
office, made answer: “By the right of
my divine duty. I am a Soothsayer,
and <em>know</em> that the Pasha of Ubikwi
hath deceived his subjects and offended
against high Heaven by palming off as
his son the female child born to his
house eighteen years agone.”</p>

<p>“And, by the divine right of my
birth,” responded the knight, “<em>I</em> know
thee to be a liar and a knave. Look
at me. I AM PRINCE MULEY,
born unto the house of my father eighteen
years ago, and neither a female
child nor a male impostor, like thee.
Die, dog, with the lie in thy throat!”</p>

<p>With that he set spurs to his horse,
and the point of his lance came out
through the back of the Soothsayer’s
neck. Whereat all the people cried
out, as with one voice, “Long live
Prince Muley, the son of his noble
father, Muley Mustapha!”</p>

<p>But Muley Mustapha merely gasped
in wonder, as not comprehending the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
simple way in which the truth had been
witnessed and error confuted,—as, indeed,
a wiser man might have wondered,
had he not been told the explanation
given in the next and concluding
chapter.</p>

<h3>This Book is a Mirror wherein the Wise Man
seeth Wisdom but the Fool seeth Folly.—<em>Shacabac.</em></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">“I don’t</span> think that I quite understand,”
began Muley Mustapha,
when he found himself
alone with his gifted spouse for a few
moments before dinner, and while the
other dignitaries were pleasantly engaged
in restoring tranquillity to the
realm by superintending the decapitation
of the disaffected.</p>

<p>“You mean that you don’t quite
understand that you think,” interposed
the good lady, sweetly. “Well, I will
explain. The child whom you wickedly
designed to bring up in a life of
shame and turbulence was not, as you
thought, a girl, but a boy!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>“I determined, as I think I told you
at the time, to save the innocent being
from the contamination of a wicked
world and the evil example of an unworthy
sire. The Physician whom
you ruthlessly put to death consented
to the pious deception, for which I
have ever revered his memory. He
was a worthy man, and understood my
nervous system better than any leech
that I have ever known. Another
kind of husband would have appreciated
his merits, but let that pass.
As for the old Soothsayer, he deserved
his doom for lacking faith in his own
predictions. I regret not his death.
No government can be conducted safely
unless its members be able to convince
themselves and others that with them
all wisdom dieth. Frequent changes
of administration, save in favor of our
own party, are disastrous to the welfare
of any country.</p>

<p>“Henceforth place your trust in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
me; and I will see to it that all official
prophecies come out correctly, though
it cost a new soothsayer every week.</p>

<p>“I leave you now,” she added, “to
prepare my daughter-in-law for her
bridal, and to instruct her in the proper
way of managing a husband. I fear
me much that the present Queen of
Nhulpar is sadly lacking in decision of
character. His Majesty the King, I
am told, keepeth State secrets from her
ears,—a great error on the part of a
dutiful spouse.”</p>

<p>It was even as the good Kayenna
had said. Young Muley Mustapha
was a genuine Prince, with all his
father’s old-time courage, re-enforced by
a strain of firmness inherited from his
noble mother. The rebel horde, who
had taken up the false Soothsayer’s
taunt that the youth was effeminate, no
longer repeated the insult, partly because
the lad had proved his manhood
on the field, but chiefly because, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
Al Choppah had finished his work, not
one of them was left to talk indiscreetly,
nor, indeed, to talk at all.</p>

<p>Despite, or perhaps because of, the
harem seclusion in which he had been
reared, the youth was more than commonly
free from bashfulness in the
presence of women; and his own
harem (for he did not copy his sire’s
monogamous example) was ruled by
him in right royal fashion. “In numbers
is safety,” was his sagacious
maxim. Yet, because of the mystery
surrounding his youth, he was ever
known throughout three kingdoms as
“Her Majesty the King.”</p>

<p>When the aged Pasha went to his
account, a few years later, everybody
in official position said, as with one
voice, that, with the exception of his
illustrious successor, he was the wisest
and best ruler that had ever reigned in
Ubikwi. The same had been said of
his sire and his grandsire and his greatgrandsire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
so that it was evident that
virtue and wisdom were hereditary in
that noble family, as they are in all
reigning dynasties everywhere.</p>

<p>Kayenna lived to see her son mount
successively the thrones of Ubikwi,
Kopaul, and Nhulpar, and to supervise
the education of a large and interesting
family of children and grandchildren,
dying at the last of a tetanus
superinduced by the arduous labor of
umpiring a debate on “Woman Suffrage.”</p>

<p>Shacabac lived to a ripe old age.
Of his latter years his biographer says,
“Allah had granted to him length of
days and the divine faculty of repose,
so that, while saying much, he thought
but little, and worked hardly at all.”</p>

<p>When his mental faculties had become
sufficiently impaired, the gallant
King of Nhulpar appointed him
Regius Professor of Political Economy
in the National University,—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
position which he filled with great
credit for many years. By his thoughtful
lectures and essays, “Patriotism
Another Name for Selfishness,” “A
Nation’s Debt a Nation’s Wealth,”
“Our Country always Wrong,”—and
especially by his erudite monograph on
“Finance,” so profound that not even
the ablest minds could comprehend
it,—his fame spread throughout all
lands, and made him the envy of
philosophers all over the earth. His
stately monument bears the simple
motto which governed him through
life,—</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent">“LOVE THYSELF: SO SHALL THY<br>
AFFECTION BE RETURNED.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> the great and good
Shacabac had completed, as
he thought, his incomparable
book of Wisdom, he said to himself,
“Here at last, is a perfect work
of mortal man,” and went, none too
humbly, to the venerable philosopher
Woppajah, from whom he had imbibed
his first draughts of knowledge. But
the Master, after skimming a few lines
and paying the tribute of a yawn,
turned over the leaves until he came
to the last chapter, when he pointed
his finger to the number thereof, and,
lo, it was the fatal number—thirteen!</p>

<p>Abashed at the silent rebuke, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
Sage would have withdrawn in confusion,
but the good man bade him stay.
“Let this,” he said, “be a lesson unto
thee; and, that thou mayst ever be
ready to extract the cork of hope from
the demijohn of disappointment, and
avert the debasing influence of superstition
by always heading off an inauspicious
omen, write now a fourteenth
chapter and bestow it upon a grateful
world, which ever rejoiceth to get
something for which it hath paid
naught.”</p>

<p>Rakkam, the tooth-puller, built up
an enormous trade and grew in riches,
by drawing two teeth for one price,
and even though one of them were
sound, the patient would boast that he
was so much ahead, which meant out
of his head.</p>

<p>It is a simple world and easily
pleased. Ali-Kazam, the wise, when
his partner said: “Here be three
apples to divide between us twain, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
neither of us hath a knife to carve them
withal,” merely replied, “Naught could
be easier, my brother.” So saying, he
ate one apple, and handing another to
his partner, said, “Behold, we now
have one apiece.” Thus was justice
attained and wisdom rewarded.</p>

<p>Gratitude is one of the invertebrate
virtues. It doth not crowd its more
robust brothers out of the way in order
to push to the front and assert itself
obtrusively. Even when sought, it
shrinks from notice, or modestly withdraws
entirely from the field of action.
Saped, a young man whose wisdom had
not grown apace with his liver, once
complained to a great physician that
his head ached in the morning and
that he had no desire to break his fast,
adding, “I fear me that I must have
eaten something that disagreed with
me.” Now the physician could read
the human face without glasses, and
scanning the grapevine tendrils which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
adorned the cheeks of the young man,
he said, “Nay, I am sure it was not
anything that you have eaten,” with a
significant emphasis on the last word.</p>

<p>“But,” cried the youth, “it could
not have been anything that I <em>omitted</em>
to eat.” The physician, unheeding
this remark, continued, “Henceforth,
if you would escape headaches and
other ills of the flesh, you must drink
wine only at dinner.” The young
man thanked him and went away, saying
to the people that the physician had
counselled him to dine all the time.
But the physician was not grateful for
the good report, nor was Saped any
longer, after he had received the bill
of the wise leech.</p>

<p>Many a man is grateful at being told
a piece of news, until he is enjoined to
keep a secret. Then doth it weigh
like a millstone around his neck or a
wife upon his knees.</p>

<p>Some are grateful, though possessing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
neither wealth nor health nor high
station, because they have had illustrious
ancestors. It is a harmless kind
of pride; for who would be cruel
enough to ask them if such “descent”
did not also imply degeneracy?</p>

<p>Many a man who never murmured
at poverty complaineth loudly when
he hath grown rich enough to be assessed
for taxes.</p>

<p>When Adam was expelled for eating
the apple he blamed “the woman.”
She said naught, but years afterwards
she invented pie; and the worst of
these is apple-pie.</p>

<p>A conscientious publisher, who had
printed an unauthorized edition of a
great work (which modesty forbids
mentioning here by name), was stricken
with contrition some months afterwards,
and wrote to the author saying:
“Truly, kind Sir, I know that I have
erred in publishing your invaluable
work without leave, but, albeit there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
is no legal obligation on me to recognize
your interests, in the absence
of any rational copyright law, yet my
soul tells me that you have a moral
right which may not be denied.
Wherefore I have directed that a statement
of account of sales be sent to you
herewith. As you will perceive that
the venture unhappily hath resulted in
a loss, your remittance of a moiety
thereof will be received by me with a
gratitude which will go far toward
allaying the pangs of a remorse-torn
sinner.”</p>

<p>The prudent pirate burieth not his
treasure in a remote cave or sandbank,
but bestoweth it in the safety deposit
vaults, for the day when he may have
to face a stern but not implacable jury.</p>

<p>The truly good man may love his
enemies; but it taketh a hermit, dwelling
alone on an inaccessible island, to
love his neighbors.</p>

<p>When the great Caliph Omar—may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
his memory be forever blessed!—beheld
the mountain of manuscripts
heaped up in the Alexandrian
Library, he asked, “Of what doth this
Himalaya consist?” The Librarian,
proudly waving his hand about, replied:
“For the greater part, or say about
ninety-five per centum, it consisteth
of inestimable works of fiction based
strictly upon the facts and so forth of
History. They have all been selected
from the best-selling nov—” But the
Caliph, who had the gift of prophecy
and could foresee even unto the present
day, and perceived also that the
folios were extremely dry, ordered that
they be all fed to the furnaces of the
baths, which had not been lighted for
many moons because that the Egyptian
tyrant, Kholrobba, had oppressed the
people with a Fuel Trust. Allah is
just, and the soul of Kholrobba suffered
not from cold when it went home.</p>

<p>A conqueror’s hymn of thanksgiving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
for victory needeth no wings. It reacheth
its destination by the force of
gravity.</p>
